# Name The Show

A sample skill which demonstrates the use of consumables within an Alexa skill.

The skill will present the user with the name of an actor or actress, and the user is asked to guess which television show the skill is thinking of.  If the user can't figure it out, they can buy and use hints, which will give them the name of a second or third actor from the same show.

To use this sample:

1. Ensure you have/complete the necessary prerequisites:
    * Alexa Developer Account
    * AWS Account
    * Intial and initizalize the ASK CLI
    * Install git (optional)
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-name-the-show name-the-show`.  If you don't have git installed, down the repo [here](https://)
1. Enter the cloned repo's directory: `cd name-the-show`.
1. Deploy the skill: `ask deploy`
1. That's it!  The skill should be enabled on your developer account.  Launch the skill by saying, **"Alexa, open name the show"**.
