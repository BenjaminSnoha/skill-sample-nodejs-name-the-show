## Name The Show

A sample skill which demonstrates the use of consumables within an Alexa skill.

The skill will present the user with the name of an actor or actress, and the user is asked to guess which television show the skill is thinking of.  If the user can't figure it out, they can buy and use hints, which will give them the name of a second or third actor from the same show.
